        Legal Advice - Food safety and food standard
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Once your food business is operating and trading, you cannot avoid
        <b>food safety inspection </b>carried out by your local authority
        enforcement officers i.e. Environmental Health Officers (EHO) or Food
        Safety Officers (FSO). Both EHO's and FSO's have powers to take
        enforcement actions against you and your business if you breach food
        safety and standardregulations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Enforcement can be a letter requiring you to comply, or it can escalate
        to the service of Improvement/Prohibition Notices or, in some
        unfortunate events, a closure of your food business, resulting in
        prosecution.
      </p>
      <p class=" text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        eKatering staff are qualified EHO's with years of experience in
        providing <b>food safety guidelines</b> to private chefs and home/event
        caterers. We also help restaurants and chefs comply with food safety and
        standard laws and practices of local authority enforcement.
        Additionally, we can advise you on any letters or
        Improvement/Prohibition Notices and, when requested, can liaise with the
        enforcement officer on your behalf.

        What is Food Standard?
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Food standard looks at a set of criteria that a food must meet to be
        suitable for human consumption, such as source, composition, appearance,
        freshness, permissible additives, and food allergens. It also requires
        that food is correctly labelled and adheres to food labelling
        regulations.
