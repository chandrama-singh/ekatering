        Legal Advice - Food Safety and Food Standard
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Once your food business is operating and trading, you cannot avoid food
        safety and standard inspections carried out by your local authority
        enforcement officers i.e. Environmental Health Officers (EHO) or Food
        Safety Officers (FSO). Both EHO's and FSO's have powers to take
        enforcement actions against you and your business if you breach food
        safety and standard regulations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Enforcement can be a letter requiring you to comply, or it can escalate
        to the service of Improvement/Prohibition Notices or, in some
        unfortunate events, a closure of your food business, resulting in
        prosecution.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        eKatering staff are qualified EHO's with years of experience in dealing
        with food safety and standard laws and practices of local authority
        enforcement. We can advise you on any letters or Improvement/Prohibition
        Notices and, when requested, can liaise with the enforcement officer on
        your behalf.
