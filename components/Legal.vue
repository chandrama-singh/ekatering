        Legal Advice Food safety and food standard
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Once your food business is in operation and trading, you cannot avoid
        food safety, and standard inspections carried out by your local
        authority enforcement officers i.e., Environmental Health Officers (EHO)
        or Food Safety Officers (FSO). Both EHO's and FSO's have powers to take
        enforcement actions against you and your business if you breach food
        safety and standard regulations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Enforcement can be a letter requiring you to comply, or it can escalate
        to the service of Improvement/Prohibition Notices or, in some
        unfortunate event, a closure of your food business, resulting in
        prosecution.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        eKatering staff are qualified EHO's with years' experience in dealing
        with food safety and standard laws and practices of local authority
        enforcement. We can advise you on any letters or Improvement/Prohibition
        Notices and, when requested, can liaise with the enforcement officer on
        your behalf.

        What is Food Standard?
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Food standard looks at a set of criteria that a food must meet to be
        suitable for human consumption, such as source, composition, appearance,
        freshness, permissible additives, and food allergens. It also requires
        that food is correctly labelled and adheres to food labelling
        regulations.
