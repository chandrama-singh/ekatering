        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">We offer a step-by-step solution to Home/Events Caterers and Private Chefs to open and run their food business online while complying with food safety and standard regulations.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Before you set up your food business, you must ensure you are competent to run a food business. This will give your Environmental Health Officer (EHO) or Food Safety Officer (FSO) the confidence and evidence that you know what you are doing. When you are inspected, you will be asked about this and questioend on food safety and food standard-related issues to asses your knowledge.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">The level of training you have must be appropriate for the level of work activity being undertaken. eKatering has developed practical eLearning training specifically for home/event caterers and private chefs. The eKatering online training, Food Safety for Caterers and Private Chefs - Level 2 and Food Allergen for Caterers and Private Chefs - Level 1 are eLearning courses that can also be useful to other small catering businesses such as restaurants and takeaways</p>
