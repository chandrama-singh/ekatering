  <p class="px-12 mt-10">Since the pandemic, our way of living has changed. The percentage of home working has increased. This has provided an opportunity for those working at home to buy home-cooked, nutritional, interesting, and authentic food prepared in a kitchen that compiles with food safety regulations. Homeworking customers can also support their community financially by using local home catering businesses.</p>
  <p class="px-12 mt-4">For those individuals, especially those in the hospitality sector, running a home catering business (Home/Event caterers and Private Chefs) can provide income for their household without the overhead expenses of running a takeaway or restaurant. Home/Event caterers and Private Chefs can turn their passion into cash.</p>
