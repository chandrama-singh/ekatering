        Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) Pack Coaching
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) was developed by the Food Standard Agency (FSA) to help small food businesses comply with food hygiene and standard regulations and produce safe food. It is a practical and simplified form of a documented food safety management system. For every business that sells food, even if you are not cooking any food, you must have this in place. <b>It's the LAW.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
       The FSA has produced different types of SFBB packs, to suit different cuisine. It has also produced specific packs for retail food businesses as well as catering businesses. eKatering experienced staff will be able to advise you on the best pack for your business and coach you through the pack, ensuring it is completed and implemented correctly.
